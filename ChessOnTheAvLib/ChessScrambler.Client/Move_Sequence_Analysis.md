## Overview
This document analyzes the specific move sequence you mentioned and how the ChessScrambler application handles each move.

## Move Sequence Breakdown

### Move 1: NxE5 (White Knight captures on E5)
- **Notation**: `Nxe5`
- **Description**: White knight captures a piece on e5
- **Implementation**: 
  - Piece type: Knight (N)
  - Capture: Yes (x)
  - Target: e5
  - Check/Checkmate: None initially

### Move 1: NxE4 (Black Knight captures on E4)
- **Notation**: `Nxe4`
- **Description**: Black knight captures a piece on e4
- **Implementation**:
  - Piece type: Knight (N)
  - Capture: Yes (x)
  - Target: e4
  - Check/Checkmate: None initially

### Move 2: QF3 (White Queen moves to F3)
- **Notation**: `Qf3`
- **Description**: White queen moves to f3
- **Implementation**:
  - Piece type: Queen (Q)
  - Capture: No
  - Target: f3
  - Check/Checkmate: None initially

### Move 2: A6 (Black Pawn moves to A6)
- **Notation**: `a6`
- **Description**: Black pawn moves to a6
- **Implementation**:
  - Piece type: Pawn (no letter)
  - Capture: No
  - Target: a6
  - Check/Checkmate: None initially

### Move 3: QxF7# (White Queen captures on F7 - CHECKMATE)
- **Notation**: `Qxf7#`
- **Description**: White queen captures on f7, delivering checkmate
- **Implementation**:
  - Piece type: Queen (Q)
  - Capture: Yes (x)
  - Target: f7
  - Check/Checkmate: Checkmate (#)

## How the Application Handles This Sequence

### 1. Move Validation
Each move is validated using the ChessDotNet library:
- **Bounds Check**: Verify source and destination are within board
- **Legal Move Check**: Ensure the move is legal according to chess rules
- **Piece Type Detection**: Automatically determine piece type from source square

### 2. Move Notation Generation
The application generates proper algebraic notation:
- **Basic Format**: `[piece][capture][target][check/checkmate]`
- **Pawn Moves**: No piece letter (e.g., `a6`)
- **Piece Moves**: Include piece letter (e.g., `Qf3`, `Nxe5`)
- **Captures**: Include "x" (e.g., `Qxf7`)
- **Checkmate**: Include "#" (e.g., `Qxf7#`)

### 3. Checkmate Detection
The application detects checkmate by:
- **Timing**: Checking AFTER the move is made
- **Method**: Using ChessDotNet's `IsCheckmated()` method
- **Notation Update**: Adding "#" to the move notation
- **Game State**: Updating game over status and showing popup

### 4. Move History Display
The moves are displayed in the UI as:
```
1. Nxe5 Nxe4 2. Qf3 a6 3. Qxf7#
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Move Class Properties
```csharp
public class Move
{
    public Position From { get; set; }           // Source square
    public Position To { get; set; }             // Destination square
    public PieceType PieceType { get; set; }     // Type of piece
    public bool IsCapture { get; set; }          // Whether it's a capture
    public bool IsCheck { get; set; }            // Whether it's check
    public bool IsCheckmate { get; set; }        // Whether it's checkmate
    // ... other properties
}
```

### Move Notation Methods
```csharp
// Basic notation (used in simple cases)
public string GetNotation()

// Full algebraic notation with disambiguation
public string GetAlgebraicNotation(ChessBoard board)
```

### Checkmate Detection Logic
```csharp
// After a successful move
var currentPlayerColor = _chessGame.WhoseTurn == Player.White ? PieceColor.White : PieceColor.Black;
move.IsCheck = IsInCheck(currentPlayerColor);
move.IsCheckmate = IsCheckmate(currentPlayerColor);
```

## Expected Behavior

### During Gameplay
1. **Move 1**: White plays `Nxe5` - move is validated and recorded
2. **Move 1**: Black plays `Nxe4` - move is validated and recorded
3. **Move 2**: White plays `Qf3` - move is validated and recorded
4. **Move 2**: Black plays `a6` - move is validated and recorded
5. **Move 3**: White plays `Qxf7#` - move is validated, checkmate detected, game ends

### UI Updates
- **Move History**: Shows all moves with proper notation
- **Game Status**: Updates to show checkmate when it occurs
- **Popup**: Shows game over popup with checkmate message
- **Board**: Highlights the final move and shows game over state

### Logging Output
When using the `--game-only` flag, you'll see:
```
[GAME] Move added to history. Total moves: 1
[GAME] Move is check: False, is checkmate: False
[GAME] Move added to history. Total moves: 2
[GAME] Move is check: False, is checkmate: False
[GAME] Move added to history. Total moves: 3
[GAME] Move is check: False, is checkmate: False
[GAME] Move added to history. Total moves: 4
[GAME] Move is check: False, is checkmate: False
[GAME] Move added to history. Total moves: 5
[GAME] Move is check: False, is checkmate: True
```

## Conclusion

The ChessScrambler application properly handles this move sequence by:
1. **Validating** each move according to chess rules
2. **Generating** proper algebraic notation
3. **Detecting** checkmate when it occurs
4. **Updating** the UI to reflect the game state
5. **Logging** all move information for debugging

The checkmate detection fix ensures that the final move `Qxf7#` will be properly recognized as checkmate and the game will end with the appropriate UI updates.
