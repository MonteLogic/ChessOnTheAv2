# Roadmap

- Add a evaluation engine of the position.
- Revamp UI to be in accordance with LiChess or other mainstream platforms. 
- Add green marker for 10 moves which were the best. Also, make the grading more accordant to top chess players rather than engines as engines lines often appear counter intuitive and hacky.
