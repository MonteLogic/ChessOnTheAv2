Chess trainer so you can run through hundreds of postions for middle game practice. As well as real time feedback

Currently you have to play the game of Chess and then look back at what you did. Yes you do have game modes where you have hints and takebacks but that doesn't provide a realtime feedback. You should have a flashing red screen when you blunder.
